Assessment 1: IT Profile

Personal Information:

Name - Jeremy Naupay

Student ID - S3831039

E-mail - S3831039@student.rmit.edu.au

Background:
I am an Australian born citizen with Hungarian and Peruvian origins. Completed Year 12 Highschool Certification and cannot speak in another language besides English. I love working with model train sets and designing new tracks at home. 


Interest in IT:

I am interested in putting together computers and connecting them with other devices. I believe this interest developed while being around my friends who were originally interested in IT. This led me to spend my own time on a computer and see what it could do, or by going on YouTube and watching reviewers explain PC hardware. I began teaching myself trouble shooting methods and how applications integrate with Windows based systems. Through this I have been able to go for work experience roles, which has allowed me to be given an opportunity to work in the IT industry. This has been an exciting role, as it has exposed me to many different computer configurations seen in a corporate setting. 

Enrolling to RMIT for a Bachelor of Information Technology has excited me to not only have a degree to further my career, but also to extend my IT knowledge base. At RMIT, I have the opportunity to work with people that have multiple backgrounds and knowledge of the IT industry. I believe it to be a powerful tool when like-minded students come together to learn and develop their skills. Especially when there is a wide range of experiences from different students coming on all sides within the industry. Some from high school and others who have been in IT for over 10 years. All of these different people coming from different walks of IT contribute to a more long-lasting course experience.

Being able to work as a team and core technical IT knowledge is what I am expecting to learn while going through this course. Working with other IT minded members will help me to know how different people interact with each other and how I can work with them. All coming down to changing my mindset from being isolated to knowing that there is a bigger community of like-minded people. 
I expect to learn how to develop a solution to an existing problem we face within the industry. For example, Due to the advancement of technology and how involved it is with our daily lives, it is important to ensure a measure of security so that information about ourselves isn’t exposed to the wrong people. I would like to aim for higher security measures to ensure that the user base does not have their personal data taken from them without realising it. I hope to develop a deeper understanding of how this can be achieved while going through the course.

Detailed Requirements Descriptions:
The Chief Technology officer position is to manage the ICT department in meeting the business needs of the organisation and external service needs for the public. This may include dealing with strategical implementation of the ICT infrastructure to further improve customer service performance towards clients. Further supporting the development of internal services to improve the efficiency of the organisation to provide a more stable structure, which will improve reliability with the client base. I believe that this role, in its very core, a position that aims at developing the infrastructure of Australia and further advancing our technological means for further development e.g. residential expansion. I do see the position as having a broader approach on ICT functions within Australia instead of being limited to a small business with no real understanding of the changing trends within the bigger society. 
It is a must to at least have a degree within IT and extensive prior knowledge in ICT management before going ahead with the role. Knowing how important it is functioning in an ICT department from the lowest points in both hardware and application to ensure the vision is allowing everyone you manage and deal with to benefit from it. Further to this is prior management experience, which allows for clear understanding how team operation functions, as the industry grows. 
My current experience is in the field of Application Support Officer for a few years. Currently in a Help Desk consultant role helping clients out with the current application they work with in order to run a business. These experiences help me in further developing myself as I work towards a bachelor’s degree. Eventually moving over into a team leader role within help desk to increase my managing experience. After finishing my bachelor degree, I am either thinking of doing a masters or moving into a degree in business. With these steps I am hoping it will lead me to greater opportunities of growth to then be in a CIO position in the next 8-10 years.

These test results show that I am leaning towards a more visual, interactive lifestyle with people. Looking at the first set of results encourages me and shows that I am an all-rounder with my personality. It helps me to understand who I am in both mindset and lifestyle wise and how I interact with the world around me. It shows me that I still have areas in my life where I need improvement, especially in listening, retaining information and implementing it in my everyday life.  

I believe it is essential that I take into consideration of my weakness within the team, as I am more visual/direct in my approach. I think it will be harder for me to understand or retain ideas discussed by other members if I do not see the idea visually shown and noted down for future reference. This can prove to be an issue when playing my part in the implementation of the idea agreed upon after the discussion.

When forming a team, it is important to know who is available and what experience they carry. I need to look for people who have that experience in team-based areas and be able to understand how to balance out my weaknesses for the benefit of the group. For this to occur I will need to effectively communicate my weakness on audio retention. I can do this by letting everyone know at the start of the meeting if we can show visual examples. This will ensure the team will become more aware on how they communicate ideas to me or others. This is a good growing experience when listening to other people in the group and being able to adapt to that new environment of team work.

Project Idea:

A mobile phone app that integrates with a sensor pointing towards a database, which reads the data of the potted plant and the requirements needed for the plant to grow. This app connects with the sensor positioned on the inside of the pot plant toward the edge. Reading soil data in real-time to then report back to the app with results to notify the user on what the plant is needing for maintenance. For example, the plant will report data on:
•	Moisture content water within the soil
•	Type of soil required for the plant
•	Soil meets the need of the plant for growth.

This will assist in educating people on correct agricultural practices when dealing with potted plants and small vegetable beds. 

In my own experience, seeing how my friends talk about taking care of plants and eventually killing the plant, or at home when I see family members looking after plants. I often wonder if there is some way to monitor the plant’s vitals and meet the recommended living conditions for its survival and growth in the home. Integration between mobile phones and sensors allow for easy monitoring of the plant during the day or night. This can prove to be a useful tool in leveraging mobile technology to educate the populace for simple plant caring. 

To expand on the idea of integration of mobile devices and sensors to monitor and regulate the needs of plant life. Plants not only include flowers, but vegetables or small garden troves for numerous plants.
The features are outlined in the List below:

-	Sensor (sold at flower shops, D.I.Y. shops) that has a distinct QR code on it and can be paired with the user’s account e.g. Apple App Store or Play store. This QR code is related to the plant given by the manufacturer on what species of plant is it.
-	Sensor that picks up real-time moisture content, which updates the mobile app.
-	Mobile Application with live database data, which can be saved on to the device and continually syncing with the cloud to ensure up to date information is received on plant data.
-	Database storing numerous scientific information collated into different categories, which is easy to understand for the end user. This Includes updated scientific data from botanists as new discoveries of plant maintenance is learned. 
-	Live Weather data or environment warnings sent out by the government e.g. Water restriction levels, fire danger etc.
-	Notifications if the plant needs more water or will require a re-plant into a bigger pot for growth.
-	Educational program for schools. Teachers receive guides on lessons based on the application and students receive tasks or information that the teacher sends out through the dashboard.
-	Great for both beginners and experts with an easy to use UI. Able to switch between a beginner UI and advanced UI. Beginner UI has basic information, which is easy to understand for people who are in a rush, want to get the job done or educational purposes. Advanced UI has more advanced information on plant data, such as the full extent of information received by the sensor and scientific data, which can be read for more complicated setups.
-	Guides given by botanist experts for tending small gardens to larger ones. 
The ultimate purpose of this project is to bring together all sorts of scientific data and be able to assist with people in finding the correct resources, real-time data for assistance with backyard pot plant and vegetable bed assistance. The A very important issue we will face is how private data is handled by large corporations who opt-in for the program. We would need to undertake critical measures to ensure that all data received by the customer is encrypted. Allowing for the customer to be able to export the data and delete it if they desire. 

Another important issue we will face is to ensure that the information used is appropriately credited to the owners of that data. The deal would allow for companies that update their data to have complete control on whether the data can be re-used in different methods on the platform. With this agreement a subscription service will be implemented with the customer base to allow compensation of live data on the platform from these larger companies. This subscription will pay for the developers, server equipment and the large organisations, which host the data and are willing to export into our database with up to date information. 

I believe software developers would be crucial in this development process. The core basis of the product is to develop an application, which utilises the full functionality of what mobile phones are capable of. This would include Network Engineers, IT Administrators, Software Testers and Support Staff for ensuring continual support of the product. We would be able to utilize Adobe PhoneGap, as an open source app developer for cross platform integration. We would require sensors manufactured according to our designs and programming from the developers that would allow for improved integration.
In order to undertake the project, the following skills will be required:
-	Detailed understanding in Javascript, HTML, CSS and C++. With other languages if required as the project continues.
-	Database management
-	Problem solving skills 
-	Extensive Networking knowledge

After our extended marketing program we should see a surge of users opting in for the subscription and an increase in agricultural sales for plant sellers who opt in for the program. We would also see an increase in educational uses within schools. Students would be able to learn through the educational program on how to tend potted plants. Learning about the life cycle and scientific complexities behind organic organisms. I believe this application will see a great impact in allowing more people to be informed on how to look after the environment and ensuring that users are doing their best to make living conditions better for the garden.
